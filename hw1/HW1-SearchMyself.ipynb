against abortion ! An abortion can result in medical complications later in life . In the future , woman who did abortion may never be a mother , even if she really want it . Another reason is that this is reduce human rights . The unborn child is alive from the moment of conception and has the right to life . \n","\n","pro con It 's a degradation when it deviates from the purpose for which it was designed . A law should be based on what is right , not personal preference . I would prefer adults control their desires in order that society might function at its best . What if my desire was n't sexual , let 's say I have a strong desire to shoot people who make me mad . Should I act on it ? You will say that hurts people and sex does n't . Really , check out Ted Bundy 's story sometime or the thousands of others like it . Consider child pornography , rape etc etc . Or maybe the sexual abuse of women does n't bother you . Sex outside of it 's proper context is always , in every situation , damaging and hurtful to both parties . And if you disagree you are numb to it 's effect . However , if you do n't have sex you do n't get pregnant . And you ca n't transmit sexually transmitted diseases without sexual contact . It 's that simple . About that baby , it 's not a part of you . It has it 's own unique DNA . It 's not yours , so it 's not you . It is a unique and separate human being that you happen to be hosting . That is the undisputed consensus . about reducing the numbers of abortions : So if I make a heartbreaking decision after a heavy consideration to start killing all homeless people because they are sad , addicted , get beat up and we as a society ca n't support them anymore . It 's OK because it was a hard decision ? Yeah right , try that defense in a court of law . None of those reasons you give come close to proper justification for the taking of human life . A pregnancy is not the kids fault , but it is the parents responsibility . And kids should never get the death penalty because their parents do n't want to take responsibility for them . The right thing to do is give them to someone who will . Have you ever had any success with something that you decided from the start that it would never work . Trouble is there are more voices telling kids to have sex than not . Suppose it was the other way around , what do you think would happen to all these problems ? Go away ? No , but they might return to the levels they were at prior to the sexual revolution . Abstinence only worked well in this country for awhile to curb these problems . And perfection is never a requirement for law . it 's meant to reduce the numbers . Slow our stampede into social anarchy if you will . \n","\n","pro con So you would say that it is better that 45 million + children die through abortion than a handful of women through a botched abortion . That does n't sound like progress to me : That sounds like serious moral confusion . Go check out the stats on abortion rates through out the years and you will see a staggering peak after Roe vs Wade . And yes , we would still have abortions , they would just be a whole lot fewer of them . Again , check out the stats on abortion rates before and after Roe vs Wade . \n","\n","pro con If you go to your local crisis pregnancy center and ask about adoption they will provide information and if you choose adoption they will lead you through the process . \n","\n","pro con OK YOU MAKE NO SENSE HOW CAN YOU BE REINCARNATED WHEN YOU WERE JUST ABOUT TO AND YOU GOT ABORTED ? ? ? ? \n","\n","The averaged accuracy score of 5-fold cv is 0.5983 and f1 score is 0.5983.\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"mh_-JBnn9Y_t","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":["paras = (500,1)\n","cv = CountVectorizer(stop_words='english', ngram_range=(1,3))\n","exf_k = paras[0]\n","kBest = SelectKBest(chi2, k=20)\n","clf = MultinomialNB(alpha=paras[1])\n","\n","Y = data[:,3]\n","X = data[:,0]\n","X = cv.fit_transform(X)\n","X = kBest.fit_transform(X,Y)"],"execution_count":0,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Er7t02FZ-Qay","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34},"outputId":"d39ef5e2-ce99-4507-c454-f4add84bdb8d","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1569524904277,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":747,"user":{"displayName":"Jing Qian","photoUrl":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-1wRHuRDt35U/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAM/Xix6aGg_aBo/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"00162708507068034487"}}},"source":["names = cv.get_feature_names()\n","print(np.shape(names),names[:2])"],"execution_count":122,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["(155154,) ['00', '00 01']\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"jWSBzVDw-cPM","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34},"outputId":"2003811b-5ce9-408a-f4ea-e25563938f41","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1569525057531,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":566,"user":{"displayName":"Jing Qian","photoUrl":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-1wRHuRDt35U/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAM/Xix6aGg_aBo/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"00162708507068034487"}}},"source":["k_feature_index = kBest.get_support(indices=True)\n","print(np.shape(k_feature_index),k_feature_index[:2])"],"execution_count":124,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["(20,) [ 4680 13912]\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"FJtg507d-9ze","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":34},"outputId":"76066c9e-899a-4413-b5db-6567af5f15d5","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1569525071841,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":1320,"user":{"displayName":"Jing Qian","photoUrl":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-1wRHuRDt35U/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAM/Xix6aGg_aBo/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"00162708507068034487"}}},"source":["names[k_feature_index[0]]"],"execution_count":125,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["'abortionist'"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":125}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"VWqGEHUr_Cij","colab_type":"code","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":357},"outputId":"81dab760-d144-4487-9fcf-eeb6312609db","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1569525109505,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":1157,"user":{"displayName":"Jing Qian","photoUrl":"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-1wRHuRDt35U/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAM/Xix6aGg_aBo/s64/photo.jpg","userId":"00162708507068034487"}}},"source":["for i in k_feature_index:\n","  print(names[i])"],"execution_count":127,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["abortionist\n","awareness\n","begins conception\n","choice\n","conception\n","consciousness\n","foetus\n","force\n","human\n","illegal\n","kill\n","life begins conception\n","living human\n","potential\n","potential life\n","pregnancy\n","society\n","survive outside\n","unto\n","ve\n"],"name":"stdout"}]}]}
